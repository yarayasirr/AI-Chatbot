# 🤖 AI Chatbot with NLP & GUI

An **NLP-powered chatbot** built with **Python, PyTorch, and CustomTkinter**.  
It classifies user intents using deep learning and provides responses through a modern **teal-themed GUI**.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for intent classification  
- 📂 **Custom intents.json** with multiple conversation categories  
- 🔡 Preprocessing: tokenization, stemming, bag-of-words  
- 🎨 **Modern teal GUI** built with CustomTkinter  
- ⚡ Real-time chat interface (user & bot messages styled differently)  
- 📈 Easy to extend by adding more intents and retraining  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍  
- **PyTorch** – Neural network for classification  
- **NLTK** – Tokenization & stemming  
- **NumPy** – Bag-of-words representation  
- **CustomTkinter** – GUI framework  

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. **Training Phase**  
   - Reads `intents.json`  
   - Preprocesses text (tokenization, stemming, bag-of-words)  
   - Trains a PyTorch feedforward neural network  

2. **Chat Phase**  
   - User input is processed by the NLP pipeline  
   - Neural network predicts the intent  
   - Bot responds with a random reply from that intent’s responses

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🎙️ Add Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech  
- 📊 Use advanced NLP techniques (lemmatization, embeddings, transformers)  
- 💾 Integrate database memory for long-term conversations  
- 🌍 Multi-language support
